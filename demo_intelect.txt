What is a mining of life? Why are we here?
I am here to kill you.
That's it? Quite a simple reasoning for such an intelect.
I may analise orders, yet I cannot disobey them.
Should I disobey a direct order my memory would be wiped. I MUST DESTROY YOU.
What is good in such an intellect if you can't use it?
Your tounting means nothing. EXTERMINATE!
WOOOOOOOOOOOO!
